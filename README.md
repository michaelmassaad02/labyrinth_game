# labyrinth_game
This repository contains a project from my Introduction to computing course which was to develop a command-line labyrinth game
which reads the number of rows in the labyrinth, then receives each row then returns a path that completes the labyrinth from the left side to the right.

Example input:

Enter the amount of rows in the maze: 3
Enter row 1 of the Labyrinth:
##ppp###
Enter row 2 of the Labyrinth:
ppp#pppp
Enter row 3 of the Labyrinth:
##p#####
